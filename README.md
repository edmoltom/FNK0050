This repository was created to “play” with the possibilities offered by the Freenove Robot Dog Kit for Raspberry Pi.
Part of the code comes from the [official Freenove repository] (https://github.com/Freenove/Freenove_Robot_Dog_Kit_for_Raspberry_Pi), whose work is acknowledged and appreciated.

## Objectives
 
 - Learn about computer vision.

 - Experiment with machine learning.

 - Deepen knowledge of robotics.

## Project status
This project is in its early stages; documentation and code will grow as learning progresses.

## Logging

The server application records runtime information to a rotating log file
`robot.log` in the project root. The file keeps up to three 1&nbsp;MB
rotations. Run the application normally and inspect the file with tools like
`tail -f robot.log` to monitor activity.
